This project was created by me (Matthias Lannoo). 
How to use:
- To run my project, simply copy the entire project and run it in PyCharm. The project already includes a database with a user by default. The login credentials for this user are: "test" as the username and "test" as the password. You can also delete the database file; in that case, a new empty database will be created automatically when you run the project. 

For this project, I used several sources.
Here is a list of those sources:
- To learn Python syntax, I watched this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ix9cRaBkVe0&t=8602s
- To understand the Pygame framework, I used the documentation on the Pygame website: https://www.pygame.org/docs/
- The foundation of the Pygame blackjack game is based on this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3YkdOXhFpQ
- The main menu is based on this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMBqjxcKogA&t=55s
- To learn how to work with an SQLite database in Python, I watched the following video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ohj-CqALrwk
